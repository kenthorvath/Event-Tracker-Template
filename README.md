# EventTracker: A Versatile Date and Event Tracking Calendar in LaTeX

Welcome to EventTracker, a generalized fork of the original mood tracking LaTeX calendar. We have evolved this project to cater to a broad spectrum of event and date tracking needs, offering users the flexibility to track anything from moods to activities, weather, and more. The foundation remains rooted in the robust `pgfcalendar`, but we've expanded its functionalities to make it more versatile and user-friendly.

## Features:
- **Multiple Events per Day**: Track numerous events on the same day, extending the original capability of two moods per day.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Choose colors, legends, date ranges, and more to tailor the calendar to your needs.
- **Event Categories with Icons and Patterns**: Beyond color coding, define events with specific icons or patterns for more intuitive visualization.
- **Support for Multi-day Events**: Mark events spanning several days without manual repetition.
- **Dynamic Legend Generation**: Adjusts based on the events you define, ensuring clarity regardless of the number of events you're tracking.
